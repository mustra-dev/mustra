# Patch endpoints
<!-- group: Deploy and patch; order: 34; pages: /patches -->

See which operating system and application updates each endpoint is missing, and install them now or on a schedule, with control over what is allowed.

## Before you start

- You need **Manage patches** (`patches.manage`).
- Each endpoint reports its missing updates through its own update system: Windows Update on Windows, `softwareupdate` on macOS, and apt or dnf on Linux. A Windows search can take several minutes the first time.

## See what is missing

1. Open **Patch**. **Endpoint patch readiness** summarises how many endpoints are up to date.
2. **Missing patches** lists each update and how many endpoints need it, with its severity where the vendor gives one.
3. **Devices** lists endpoints and how many updates each is missing.
4. To refresh a list now rather than wait for the next collection, choose **Rescan now**.

## Patch now

1. In **Missing patches** or **Devices**, tick what you want (**Select all shown** for everything filtered).
2. Choose **Apply patches to selected**.
3. Choose whether endpoints may restart, and confirm.
4. Follow progress under **Recent activity**.

## Apps installed by the Proxmox community scripts

An LXC set up with the [Proxmox VE community scripts](https://community-scripts.org) runs an app (Seerr, BentoPDF, BookStack, …) installed from its GitHub releases, outside the package manager. mustra lists that app beside the container's OS updates when it is behind, as `community-script:<app>`, for example `community-script:bentopdf 1.1.5 → 2.8.11`.

- **What counts as newer:** the app's latest GitHub release, or the version the script pins when its maintainers test each release first (Immich, for one). Apps whose script uses another source, or none, are not listed: the package manager or Docker updates those.
- **Applying it** runs the container's own `update` command, unattended, after its OS updates. That is what you would type yourself. It downloads the app's script from GitHub and runs it as root, and some apps take minutes.
- **It refuses on its own when it should:** a script that needs more CPU or memory than the container has stops without changing anything, and the patch run says why. Give the container what it asks for and run it again.
- **Hold apps back** with a block list entry for `community-script:*` (or one app, `community-script:immich`). A patch run of "everything" includes them otherwise, and an app's major version can change things that need you to check afterwards.
- **Inventory-and-patching mode** lists the apps but never runs their scripts.

## Patch on a schedule

1. **Patch → Deploy & Schedule**, under **Scheduled & recurring deployments**, choose **New schedule**.
2. Pick the computer groups, the days and time, and the restart behaviour.
3. Choose **Create schedule**. Schedules respect maintenance windows.

A common setup is a pilot group on Tuesday night and everyone else on Thursday night, so a bad update shows up on a few machines first.

## Allow, hold back and pin updates

**Patch Lists** control what a patch run may install:

- A **patch list** names the updates allowed; a **block list** names updates that must never be installed (for example a driver that broke laptops).
- **Assignments** apply lists to computer groups.
- **Repository lists** (Linux) choose which package repositories updates may come from.

Choose **Save list**, then **Assign** it. **Export JSON** and **Import JSON** move lists between servers.

## Read the results

Each patch run reports per endpoint which updates installed, which failed, and whether a restart is pending. An endpoint that was offline when the run started reports **no response**, which is different from **failed**.

## If something goes wrong

- **A Windows endpoint shows no patches at all:** the first Windows Update search can take up to ten minutes; check again later. If it stays empty, look under **Client Health**.
- **Linux shows updates that will not install:** the repository may require a newer package manager key; run `apt-get update` on the endpoint through Direct Connect to see the error.
