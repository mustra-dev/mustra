// Real-time process monitoring, endpoint half.
//
// The processes sensor is a snapshot on a timer. Anything that runs and
// exits between two collections never existed as far as the console is
// concerned, and "runs and exits quickly" describes most of what an
// attacker does: a curl piped to a shell, a base64-decoded one-liner, a
// scheduled task that fires and is gone. This is the half that sees those.
//
// How much it sees depends on the mechanism, and the mechanism differs by
// platform enough that the batch says which one produced it:
//
//	Linux   the kernel's process-events connector over netlink — every
//	        exec, including one that lives for two milliseconds.
//	other   a fast diff of the process table. Sees what was alive at a
//	        sample point, which means anything shorter-lived than the
//	        interval is invisible. That is a real limit, and the console
//	        says so rather than letting a quiet feed read as a quiet box.
//
// The same three bounds as file events apply, for the same reason: a build
// machine can start hundreds of processes a second, and an agent that
// reported every one faithfully would produce the flood that makes a
// security feed unreadable.
