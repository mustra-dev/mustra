// What each sensor is, and how it gets its answer.
//
// A sensor is otherwise the most opaque thing in the product: a name in a
// list, a number that may or may not be current, and no way to find out
// where it came from short of reading the agent source. That matters more
// than it sounds, because the right reaction to "patches: 5" depends
// entirely on whether that number was read from the Windows Update COM API
// two minutes ago or from a cached apt index last Tuesday.
//
// So each entry says what the sensor answers, exactly how it is collected
// per platform, what it costs the endpoint, and where it can be wrong. The
// per-OS mechanism is the part people actually ask for: "how is it pulling
// it" is the first question anyone evaluating a fleet tool asks.
//
// This is deliberately a hand-written catalog rather than generated from
// the agent. The mechanism strings are the honest, human answer -- "reads
// the ARP/NDP table, puts zero packets on the wire" -- which no amount of
// reflection over collector functions would produce.
